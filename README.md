Crucible
========

Crucible is a simple PHP framework. I am writing this framework because I wanted to have a framework of 
my own and because all the frameworks have become very complex and I wanted a framework which do not become a restriction
in my own work or imagination. 

I would not really not advice use to this framework in production environment now because its still under development 
and I will let you know when there will be any usable release available. But I would love to get your advice and help in 
any form if you are willing to give.
